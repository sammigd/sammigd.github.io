I am a PhD statistician and data scientist working in infectious disease epidemiology, vaccine and drug effectiveness, and causal inference.

In my graduate work at Yale, I developed and applied statistical methods for causal inference. I worked with Professors [Forrest Crawford](http://www.crawfordlab.io/) and [Laura Forastiere](https://ysph.yale.edu/profile/laura_forastiere/).

In my work, I use statistics to answer questions with social and policy impacts.

Examples
- Estimating COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness in Connecticut
- Evaluating interventions with treatment spillover
