I am a PhD biostatistician working in infectious disease epidemiology, vaccine and drug effectiveness, and causal inference.

In my graduate work at Yale, I developed and applied statistical methods for causal inference. I worked with Professors [Forrest Crawford](http://www.crawfordlab.io/) and [Laura Forastiere](https://ysph.yale.edu/profile/laura_forastiere/).

I am interested in using statistics to answer quesions with social and policy impacts.
