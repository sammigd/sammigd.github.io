I am a PhD biostatistician working in infectious disease epidemiology, vaccine and drug effectiveness, and causal inference.

I did my graduate work with Professors [Laura Forastiere](https://ysph.yale.edu/profile/laura_forastiere/) and [Forrest Crawford](http://www.crawfordlab.io/) at Yale, where I developed and applied statistical methods for causal inference. I am interested in using statistics to answer quesions with social and policy impacts.
