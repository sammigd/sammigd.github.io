I am a PhD statistician and data scientist. I have worked in healthcare AI, infectious disease epidemiology, vaccine and drug effectiveness, and causal inference.

I was awarded an [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) grant for my PhD at [Yale](https://ysph.yale.edu/), where I developed and applied statistical methods for causal inference. I worked with Professors [Forrest Crawford](http://www.crawfordlab.io/) and [Laura Forastiere](https://ysph.yale.edu/profile/laura_forastiere/). 

After my PhD, I was a [Modeling Fellow](https://www.cdc.gov/pef/php/about/index.html) / Mathematical Statistician at the CDC, where I worked on studies of vaccine and antiviral effectiveness. Currently, I work for [innoVet Health](https://www.innovethealth.com/) on projects improving veteran healthcare.
